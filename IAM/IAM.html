    <h1>Identity and Access Management Combining Role-Based Access Control and Attribute-Based Access Control</h1>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>With the fast development of information technology, especially with the recent rapid development of cloud
        computing, a lot of companies are moving their data from the physical media into the digital media.
        Although the digital transition greatly improved the efficiency, it also brings cybersecurity concerns that the
        digital data can be accessed where they shouldn't be accessed.
        Identity and Access Management (IAM), or in other words, authentication, and authorization, plays an important
        role in the cybersecurity world by making sure the identify can be safely verified
        and their access to certain documents can be correctly checked.
    </p>
    <h2>Proposed Work</h2>
    <p>In this work, I will implement an IAM system for authentication and authorization. The identify management system
        should store user's password securely and be able to allow valid login and deny invalid login.
        I will also implement the access control module such that it is very flexible that it can easily be applied to
        situations where RBAC is required, ABAC is required, or a hybrid of RBAC and ABAC is required. In the RBAC part,
        users will be grouped into roles, and roles will be granted to permissions. In the ABAC part, permissions will
        be assigned based on attributes from users and objects. The hybrid of RBAC and ABAC would be that users need to
        be assigned for some role and satisfy the attribute requirement as well.
        When the system is developed, I will implement an example application to show that it works well.
    </p>
